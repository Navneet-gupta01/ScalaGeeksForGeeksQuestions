   * Given a BST (Binary Search Tree) that may be unbalanced, convert it into a balanced BST that has minimum possible height.*/
  
  /*
   * Method 1:: traverse nodes in Inorder and one by one insert into a self-balancing BST like AVL tree. 
   * Time complexity of this solution is O(n Log n) and this solution doesnâ€™t guarantee
   * 
   * Method 2: Efficient Solution can construct balanced BST in O(n) time with minimum possible height. Below are steps.
   *
	 *		1.  Traverse given BST in inorder and store result in an array. This step takes O(n) time. 
	 *        Note that this array would be sorted as inorder traversal of BST always produces sorted sequence.
	 *		2.  Build a balanced BST from the above created sorted array using the recursive approach discussed here. 
	 *        This step also takes O(n) time as we traverse every element exactly once and processing an element takes O(1) time.
