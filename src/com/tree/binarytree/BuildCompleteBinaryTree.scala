  /*
   * A complete binary tree is a binary tree where each level ‘l’ except the last has 2^l nodes and the nodes 
   * at the last level are all left aligned. Complete binary trees are mainly used in heap based data structures.
   *
   * The nodes in the complete binary tree are inserted from left to right in one level at a time. If a level is full, 
   * the node is inserted in a new level.
   * 
   * Complete binary trees are generally represented using arrays. The array representation is better because it doesn’t 
   * contain any empty slot. Given parent index i, its left child is given by 2 * i + 1 and its right child is given by 2 * i + 2.
   *  So no extra space is wasted and space to store left and right pointers is saved.
