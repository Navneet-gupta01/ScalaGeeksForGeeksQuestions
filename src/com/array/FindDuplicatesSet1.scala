   * Given an array of n elements which contains elements from 0 to n-1, with any of these numbers appearing any number of times. 
   * Find these repeating numbers in O(n) and using only constant memory space.
   * 
   * extension of  FindTwoRepeatingEltsBtwn1ToN.printRepeat4 method
   * 
   * The above program doesnâ€™t handle 0 case (If 0 is present in array). The program can be easily modified to handle that also. 
   * It is not handled to keep the code simple.
   * 
   * There is a problem in above approach. It prints the repeated number more than once. For example: {1, 6, 3, 1, 3, 6, 6} it will give output as : 3 6 6. 
   * In below set, another approach is discussed that prints repeating elements only once.
