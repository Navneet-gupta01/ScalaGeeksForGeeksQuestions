   * The approach is simple, we count frequency of each element in array, then find the frequency of most frequent element in count array. 
   * Let this frequence be max_freq. To get the minimum number of elements to be deleted from array calculate n â€“ max_freq where n 
   * is number of elements in given array.*/
