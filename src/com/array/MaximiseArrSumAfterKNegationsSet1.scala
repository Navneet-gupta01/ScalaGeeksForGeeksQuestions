   * Given an array of size n and a number k. We must modify array K number of times. Here modify array means in each operation we 
   * can replace any array element arr[i] by -arr[i]. We need to perform this operation in such a way that after K operations, 
   * sum of array must be maximum?

   * his problem has very simple solution, we just have to replace the minimum element arr[i] in array by -arr[i] for current operation. 
   * In this way we can make sum of array maximum after K operations. Once interesting case is, once minimum element becomes 0, we donâ€™t
   * need to make any more changes.
