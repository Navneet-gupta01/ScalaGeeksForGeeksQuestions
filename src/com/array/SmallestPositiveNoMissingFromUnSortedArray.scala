   * http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-smallest-positive-number-missing-from-an-unsorted-array/ 
   * You are given an unsorted array with both positive and negative elements. 
   * You have to find the smallest positive number missing from the array in O(n) time using constant extra space.
   * */
  
  /*
   * A naive method to solve this problem is to search all positive integers, starting from 1 in the given array. 
   * We may have to search at most n+1 numbers in the given array. So this solution takes O(n^2) in worst case
   * */
  
  /*
   * We can use sorting to solve it in lesser time complexity. We can sort the array in O(nLogn) time. Once the array is sorted, 
   * then all we need to do is a linear scan of the array. So this approach takes O(nLogn + n) time which is O(nLogn).
   * */
  
  /*
   * We use array elements as index. To mark presence of an element x, we change the value at the index x to negative. 
   * But this approach doesnâ€™t work if there are non-positive (-ve and 0) numbers. So we segregate positive 
   * from negative numbers as first step and then apply the approach.
